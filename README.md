Javascript + karma + jasmine testing example

Simple proof of concept to some BDD using Javascript + Jasmine 2.0 and Karma as test runner.
It requires Node to be in your computer.

To install, simply run:
npm install

then you can run the tests by running:
karma start

It will open a Chrome instance an run the tests on it.
